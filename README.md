# Helmholtz-coil-config_3pair
3rd year summer research intern at "Ion Trap Quantum Computing Group", Univ of Oxford (Jun 2019)

Objective: Implement optimized coil arrangements to achieve uniform at the centre of cryogenic ion trap chamber (in this case, centre coordinate (x, y) = (85, 50)[mm])

For those of you who are unaware of what "Helmholtz configuration", check the link below:



Below is the result graph of my code:
